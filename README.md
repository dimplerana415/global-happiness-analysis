# 🌍 Glodal Happiness Analysis - World Happiness Report 2024

This project explores the *World Happiness Report 2024* dataset to understand how different social, economic, and health factors influence happiness levels across countries.

---

## 📘 About the Project
This analysis focuses on identifying patterns and relationships between happiness scores and contributing factors such as *GDP per capita,* *social support,* *healthy life expectancy, and* *freedom to make life choices*.  

The project follows a complete *data science workflow* — from loading and cleaning data to performing *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* and creating *visualizations* that highlight global trends.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- *Python*
- *Pandas*
- *NumPy*
- *Matplotlib*
- *Plotly Express*

## 📊 Steps in the Project

### ⿡ Data Loading  
Imported and inspected the dataset to understand its structure and columns.

### ⿢ Data Cleaning  
- Renamed inconsistent column names  
- Handled missing values using mean imputation  
- Removed unnecessary columns for a cleaner dataset  

### ⿣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Explored the distribution of happiness scores  
- Binned happiness levels into Low, Medium, and High  
- Investigated correlations between key factors and happiness  

### ⿤ Data Visualization  
Created insightful visualizations to better understand global patterns:
- *Bar graphs*: Frequency of happiness levels  
- *Scatter plots*: GDP, life expectancy, and social support vs happiness  
- *Box plots*: Regional happiness comparisons  
- *Choropleth map*: Global happiness distribution by country  

---

## 🌟 Key Insights
- Countries in *Northern and Western Europe* consistently rank among the happiest.  
- *GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy* show strong positive correlations with happiness.  
- A few countries exhibit *high happiness despite moderate GDP*, indicating the impact of non-economic factors.  

## 🗂 Dataset

💡 Future Work

* Build a predictive model to estimate happiness scores using regression techniques.
* Compare happiness trends across multiple years of the report.
